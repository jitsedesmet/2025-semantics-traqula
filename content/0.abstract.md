<!-- Context: Why the need is so pressing or important -->
The SPARQL ecosystem has become increasingly fragmented as engines introduce valuable but incompatible language extensions.
<!-- Need: Why something needed to be done at all -->
This growing diversity undermines query portability, tooling reliability, and the pace of innovation.
<!-- Task: What was undertaken to address the need -->
To address this, we designed a modular parser architecture that supports dynamic extension and modular grammar definitions.
<!-- Object: What the present document does or covers -->
This paper presents a builder-based, TypeScript-native parser framework inspired by Chevrotain and the modular principles of Comunica.
<!-- Findings: What the work done yielded or revealed -->
Our prototype demonstrates that key SPARQL extensions can be integrated, altered, or removed with minimal effort and strong type safety.
<!-- Conclusion: What the findings mean for the audience -->
These results suggest that modular, declarative parsing is not only feasible but essential for keeping pace with evolving SPARQL standards.
<!-- Perspectives: What the future holds, beyond this work -->
Looking forward, we identify the need for round-trippable ASTs, Babel-inspired generators, and transformer pipelines to enable a complete, future-proof SPARQL toolchain.
