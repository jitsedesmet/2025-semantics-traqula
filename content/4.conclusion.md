## Conclusion
{:#conclusion}


Future research:

1. construct default parser that can be used in various settings.
Specifically, the AST should allow for round-tripping generation,
meaning a query parsed into an AST than generated again to a query should be string identical to the first. 
2. A generator that supports round-tripping, the architecture for this generator could be inspired on the popular [Babel library].
3. An easy-to-use transformer that allows you to transform an AST into a different datastructures
