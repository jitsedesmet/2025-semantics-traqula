## Introduction
{:#introduction}

The [SPARQL query language](cite:cites spec:sparql), a cornerstone of the Semantic Web stack,
has evolved through both standardisation and real-world innovation.
While SPARQL 1.1 defines a clear and extensible foundation,
the ecosystem has gradually diverged as implementers introduced powerful but engine-specific extensions.
For example, Virtuoso offers [full-text search capabilities](cite:cites virtuoso-full-text-search),
Apache Jena supports [CONSTRUCT QUAD queries](cite:cites jena-construct-quad),
and Oxigraph provides [extended date-time-functionality including the ADJUST function](cite:cites oxigraph-adjust).
These features are often highly valuable, but also incompatible,
creating a heterogeneous landscape where queries that run on one engine may fail on another.

This diversity presents a serious challenge for SPARQL portability, tooling and federated querying.
With the finalisation of the [SPARQL 1.2 specification](cite:cites sparql-1-2),
the gap between supported language features is likely to widen further,
since migration to SPARQL 1.2 is not trivial, requiring substantial updates to the [datasets representation and underlying RDF store](cite:cites rdf-1-2).
The RDF1.1 to RDF1.2 update is substantial mainly because of the introduction of a new triple term,
specifically the object of a triple can now be a triple itself,
allowing for the recursive definition of triples since the triple contained in the object can again have a triple in the object spot.  
Moreover, the working group has announced that after SPARQL 1.2 finalisation,
they plan to move toward a more agile ["maintenance and new features" mode](https://github.com/w3c/sparql-dev/issues/32#issuecomment-2621209920),
which hints at even faster iteration cycles in the future.
As a result, there is a growing need for tooling that embraces extensibility and modularity by design.

In this work, we show the need for a modular parser and what such a parser could look like.
We are inspired by the [Comunica ecosystem](cite:cites comunica), known for its flexible and modular architecture.
Unlike traditional parser generators such as [ANTLR](cite:cites parr1995antlr) or [Bison](cite:cites bison-gnu),
which rely on Domain Specific Languages (DSLs) and generate static parsing code — our parser should be defined entirely within TypeScript.
This would eliminate the compile step, enable programmatic extension, and leverage strong typing to provide a safer,
more developer-friendly API.
The parser should not be a handwritten parser either, instead it should use declarative rules such as present in the [Chevrotain parser toolkit](cite:cites chevrotain).

A modular parser, that allows you to add, override, or swap grammar fragments at runtime,
would empower both researchers and practitioners to create a new generation of language-aware SPARQL tools.
This opens the door to use cases such as heterogeneous query tooling (e.g., adapting editors like [YASGUI](cite:cites yasgui) to custom SPARQL dialects),
while keeping maintainability in check.
Additionally, it would allow SPARQL version translation, and rapid experimentation with new language features.
In an ecosystem where SPARQL flavors are growing rather than converging,
we believe modularity is not just a nicety—it’s a necessity.

The next section touches lightly on the related work, while [](#architecture) describes the system architecture.
[](#demo) sketches the demonstration that we will provide to the workshop.
In [](#conclusion) we conclude the future work and desired impact of this research.
